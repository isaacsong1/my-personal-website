<!-- Ideas before I leave: 
  Main concept of the website is to have my name in the middle with a greeting
  to the left of it saying "Hi, I'm" and the Hi will switch between a few different
  greetings every so often. 
  Temporary idea for accessibility: Hover name and each border will expand 
  Left border moves first: About page
  Bottom border second: Information (Projects?)
  Right border moves third: contact
  Top: Something
  I am thinking I can use JS to change the property of each border then have them move with animation time
  Thinking of a simple design but aesthetic to look at.

<!-- Idea #2:
  Did some thinking while away for the weekend. I think I am going to scrap the idea above because I thought it would look tacky and not exactly how I imagine my website to look.
  I thought the center name would look off because of the rectangular shape. I am still thinking of the first thing where it greets users that stumble across my website.
  I think I will add a page for hobbies to showcase some nature related things I enjoy (Yosemite, hikes, etc.) and climbing videos/pictures/milestones.
  Maybe a photo on the front page but in a different shape, not a square/rectangle. I still want the website to be minimalistic and aesthetic but has functionality.
  Still need some thinking time to figure out a design that I am happy with.

<!-- Websites from other developers:
  I believe that the more I see and the more I learn, the more I grow. Looking at websites from other developers will inspire me to create innovative technical projects. 
  Seeing what other developers created not only shows me what technology is capable of in terms of creating a website, but also inspires me to improve and include some of my
  own creative thoughts and ideas. This will help me be a great developer.

      `A futuristic yet simplistic take on the design and has interactive elements on the page that don't clash with the aesthetics`

  - Charles Bruyerre
      `I like the reactive background with cursor movement as well as the bright colors against the soothing gray background`

      `Minimalistic website. I really like how the designer used simple colors to make a pleasing website. With minimal technical elements, I was amazed to see a nice website.`

      `This has got to be the coolest website I have seen so far. The interactive 3D landscape is just amazing. I am leaning towards making something similar to this where the user can control a character`
