<!-- Ideas before I leave: 
  Main concept of the website is to have my name in the middle with a greeting
  to the left of it saying "Hi, I'm" and the Hi will switch between a few different
  greetings every so often. 
  Temporary idea for accessibility: Hover name and each border will expand 
  Left border moves first: About page
  Bottom border second: Information (Projects?)
  Right border moves third: contact
  Top: Something
  I am thinking I can use JS to change the property of each border then have them move with animation time
  Thinking of a simple design but aesthetic to look at.

<!-- Idea #2:
  Did some thinking while away for the weekend. I think I am going to scrap the idea above because I thought it would look tacky and not exactly how I imagine my website to look.
  I thought the center name would look off because of the rectangular shape. I am still thinking of the first thing where it greets users that stumble across my website.
  I think I will add a page for hobbies to showcase some nature related things I enjoy (Yosemite, hikes, etc.) and climbing videos/pictures/milestones.
  Maybe a photo on the front page but in a different shape, not a square/rectangle. I still want the website to be minimalistic and aesthetic but has functionality.
  Still need some thinking time to figure out a design that I am happy with.
